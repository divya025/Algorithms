Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a "ginger beer" based on the smell.\t\tThe taste is very unique also. It\'s kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the "spice" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison\'s Honey Basil ale.

How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. \t\t\tTill then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.', 'user/profileName': 'RedDiamond', 'review/aroma': 1.5}

The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking.

Perfectly pleasant.\t\tTaste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale.

Love those cascade hops and the fact that this is a close 50/50 when it comes to the malt to hops flavor ratio. Great pale ale from the folks in Shakespeare land.\t \tOverall - I really enjoyed this pale ale. This is a very drinkable brew and I mean that in every way possible. Its simple yet flavorful, hoppy but also balanced. Its simply a very good beer. \t \tWould I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I could get some more of these, actually I wish I could get more of all the Caldera cans as I really enjoyed each of them very much.

I concluded that Old Growth suffered from no unintended intrusions, but I was still perplexed by its uncommon design.\t\t\tI found Old Growth on tap at the Fort George Public House in Astoria where it was featured among other notables as part of Stout Month. Fort George was serving it in 12-oz. snifters where its panoply of sharp aromas was ably focused.

The taste worked parallel to this and I was convinced I was drinking a chocolate mint elixir - pure girl scout cookie. \t\t\tOld Growth's body is oily black with sepia froth.

Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness.\t\tTaste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness.\t\tMouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated.\t\tDrinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans. The 6 pack may be an issue but I'd attempt it. \t\tGreat IPA, in a can no less.", 'user/profileName': 'cvaypai', 'review/aroma': 4.0}

Mild cookie-like sweetness from the malt has a faint toasted graininess to it. Hops come in with a controlled but precise bitterness, strong but still leaving some balance. Big minty hop flavor very slowly dissipates with citric rind, evergreen, black tea leaves and a sweet Mandarin orange flavor.

Medium bodied with a great finish that is not too sticky or dry and lingers just long enough. Very drinkable and a great, sessionable IPA.', 'user/profileName': 'zoso1967', 'review/aroma': 4.0}

The only other canned beer I have tried recently that I can recommend is Dales Pale Ale. Many people cannot believe that a decent beer can come from a can. For the most part, I agree. This, as with Dales, is an exception. Knowing a decent canned beer is valued quintessentially to those of us who enjoy the back-country experience and like to pack out what we pack in. There is something special about being able to stick a couple of really good ales or IPA's in the snow on a telemarking trek and enjoy that beverage in the raw and untamed wild. I have had a few such occasions in the beautiful Arapahoe Nat. Forest of Summit County, CO. \t\tThis ale poures into a chilled glass easily with a two to three finger, full, creamy head and leaves a sweet lacing on the glass, all the way to the last sip. The well carbonated ale continues to offer a flow of small bubbles consistently as it stands in the glass. As for the appearance, I have to say that I also am quite fond of the labeling. Anyone collecting cans should have a Caldera IPA in the line-up.\t\tS - The smell of this beer is what you want folks who think beer stinks to sample. I could imagine Caldera IPA incense, the smell is so natural and becoming. I used to appreciate deeply the aroma of the pines and aspens as I guided horseback tours in the Colorado Divide, and this is what Caldera reminds me of. \t\tT - Caldera IPA tastes delicious. I love hoppy beers and this satisfies while I would say it won't scare off those who like a hoppy beer but are somewhat easily offended. It has a nice bitterness that says a solid hello from the tip of the tongue around both sides, but doesn't try to rip apart your mucous membranes with the vigor and skill of pissed off Norseman. The flavor is complex, sensuous and mystifying. The finish is crisp and clean and as I am experiencing at this very moment, one simply is not enough. My glass is in the freezer right now getting prepped for a second round. \t\tM - This IPA has a full bodied, smooth and delightful feel that is welcome on the palate, to be savored and swallowed slowly, eyes closed and head tilted slightly aft, slowly exhaling through the nose to extract the many intricacies that the craftsmen at Caldera have steeped into this marvelous 12 ounce can. \t\tD - At 6.1%, this IPA is very, very drinkable. Beware, if you are not on foot and close to home while enjoying Caldera IPA - it can sneak up on you. Filling? Not terribly for such a well built and hardy concoction. \t\tTHE FINAL ANALYSIS: If you enjoy drinking beer, you must try Caldera IPA - especially if you like to drink out of bounds.", 'user/profileName': 'Stimwizzle', 'review/aroma': 4.5}

And I\'m wondering if the can has something to do with it. \t\tFor decades canned beer deserved the stigma attached to it. The aluminum adversely impacted the taste, lending a tawdry metallic quality that was the hallmark of industrial beer production. This problem has been solved in recent years by coating the inside of the can with a food-grade polymer that effectively keeps the beer off the aluminum. No more unsavory beer can taste. \t\tToday it\'s not merely a matter of acknowledging that canned beer "works." It\'s now prudent to ask whether it\'s an altogether better idea than beer in a bottle. And Caldera\'s IPA is a fine candidate for the notion that canned beer is an idea whose time has come. \t\t\tCaldera IPA\'s aroma is floral and leafy. The leaf is so fresh it\'s almost sticky. It imparts a tall airy head of majestic suds amid lively carbonation in a sunny topaz color. The body is vivid and clear though marred by a few wayward flocs.\t\t\tThe taste reminds me of Fire Station 5 with perfectly posited bittering that takes your hand and walks you through a lush garden of herbal hop flavor.

At least I hope so.\t\tThe nose is nicely hoppy, but it isn't explosively hoppy. I blame the fact that the brewers decided to use too much Munich and crystal at the expense of pale malt. The hops (Crystal, Galena, and Centennial) provide grapefruit and orange esters, along with a strong whiff of ganja. Close to excellent, but no cigar. Edit: by the last ounce... cigar.\t\tI feel the same way about the flavor... at least after two mouthfuls. Who knows what time, warming and the rest of the can might accomplish? These guys definitely love to hop their beer, but then that's almost a requirement in Oregon, isn't it? I wish the website listed the IBUs. I'm thinking 70ish.\t\tThe sturdy malt backbone, again, contains a healthy amount of toasted earthiness from the Munich and steely caramel from the crystal. It also provides an underlying sweetness that keeps things from being more arid on the back end than they already are. Caramel-soaked orange and grapefruit pith and peel zings across the tongue with each mouthful, leaving shallow alpha acid furrows rather than deep trenches.\t\tThe mouthfeel is IPA medium; perhaps a bit more full due to a wonderful creaminess as it gains a few degrees. The amount and feel of the carbonation strikes me as just about right. Are all 12 ounces gone already?\t\tPrior to Surly blowing the entire concept sky-high, Caldera Pale Ale was my favorite canned beer. IPA is at least as good.

A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. \t\tT: More toffee-maltiness than I\'d expected, but offset with that \'orange\' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall.\t\tM: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue.

The smell leads me to think that I'm not going to like the beer, it's all malt on the smell, almost no hops to speak of, and an amber ale should have some hops in there. Not only that, but the malt smells like it's the kind of malt I really don't like, the malt that tastes like it smells before you even brew the beer, just a complete grain taste. We will see, but the smell doesn't give me high hopes. Well on the first taste I took I couldn't really detect any hops, and frankly I thought the beer was extremely boring on the first taste. However, on the second and third sips, the hops are coming out a little bit more. The malts are for sure not too bad, they aren't really the kind of bad taste I was detecting on the smell. This is a very drinkable beer, and not bad by any means, but I frankly wish there was more taste to it. On some tastes this beer deserves a 4, but on others it deserves a 3.5, so I dunno. The taste just isn't as bold and powerful as it could be, but it is crisp and refreshing, and it does have some nice flavors to it. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, a little thin, but it does have some girth to it, not too bad. Overall a good beer, not amazing, but good. Frankly I can't find anything too wrong with it other than the smell, but I guess it just wasn't hitting on all cylinders for me, for some reason.

When I can't keep the corners of my mouth from turning down, I know that I've entered the land of the truly wretched.\t\tIn terms of mouthfeel, each beer's positive is canceled out by its negative. This one has a slightly more full mouthfeel, relatively speaking, but a much fizzier carbonation. Let's call it a draw and move on.\t\tI didn't expect much from Amstel Light in spite of the fact that it's 'the #1 imported light beer in America'. Actually, that last sentence would be more accurate if I changed 'in spite of the fact that' to 'since'. The winner of Macro Smackdown VIII has been crowned (largely due to a lack of any serious competition), but it wears that crown uneasily.

I include cheater Sam Adams Light (they stretch the definition of "light" with like 125 calories vs I think 150 for a regular bottle of Boston Lager) in that statement. Appearance is kind of odd because on the one hand it has a nice deep brown color, but on the other it is obviously a little watery looking, the result being that dark brown color is nearly transparent. It does manage to maintain a surprisingly stable head for a light beer. Smell is pleasant, you know hoppy, a bit of malt, a bit of yeast, basically what a normal beer is supposed to smell like. Taste is quite good. Some sweet malt, balanced presence of hops that are of decent quality, if not too exciting. A little yeast is in there too, and obviously this is a very clean tasting beer. Mouthfeel IS a bit on the watery side, but not to the point where you actually think you are drinking water whenever you take a sip without looking right at the glass. Drinkability is excellent since not only does this beer taste pretty good, but it obviously does not weight you down, plus you\'re packing on fewer calories and not getting as drunk either. Is this going to fool you into thinking you just drank an oatmeal stout, an extra bitter, or a dopplebock? Of course not. It is still a bit on the watery side in fact. But it does a better job of hiding the fact that its a light beer than any other I\'ve tried yet. And that slighty watery liquid at least has some real beer flavor present, if not as much richness as even I would like. Take it from me, you are not likely to find a better light beer in a regular bar.

Nice side glass presentation as well, very impressively done I have to admit.  Rich licorice and cocoa straight up front, very deep and complex as it rolls though. Nice mellow, vanilla notes coming up now as it warms as well as a rich, molasses and coffee aroma. Smooth, delicate, a definite dessert beer for sure, this one was coming off quite well on me I have to admit. First notes of coffee and molasses coat the tongue while a biting hop note then takes over, interesting. Dark fruits play around on the palate as dark chocolate explores and brings you down to a smooth, sweet finish. A big one for sure, but it holds its own. \t \tOverall, very, very solid here. Needed a little more punch for me in the back of the taste, but otherwise this one was top notch for sure. I would have no issue at all with trying one again any day.', 'user/profileName': 'mikesgroove', 'review/aroma': 5.0}

Basically it was a recipe that was passed around to a bunch of places and they all brewed the same thing, and this was theirs.\t\tI was drinking it on their patio at night, so the lighting was odd and it was tough to get a clear idea of the color.

I had just come from a Belgian brewpub down the road, and this was better then what they put out.

On my deathbed, I\'ll take an IV drip of Wobbly Bob. It\'s in my will, no shit. This is the definition of a session beer.\t\tI can\'t say enough about this beer... I\'m reviewing it months after it was on tap last... it is forever ingrained in my mind.

I wanted to classify it as a fruit/vegetable beer but apparently that category is being removed from the site.ReallyI think it is most like a pumpkin ale- without the pumpkin. In the south the pumpkin and the sweet potato are pretty interchangeable as pie filling, and the effect on a beer is about the same as well. Feel free to reclassify it if everyone decides it belongs elsewhere. The pumpkin pie spice (and crushed pumpkin seeds with sugar) are available at the brewery as a rimmer on the pint glass. I think its better without. The beer itself pours amber with no head with an appetizing smell of baked sweet potato and spice. The taste is a little more subdued, but there is a fresh pumpkin (sweetpotato) taste and that familiar pumpkin creaminess/soapiness in the mouthfeel.

The alcohol is masked well in that there is no warming rush at any time, so be warned.\t\tThis seems like an unrefined, rather crude version of the genre.

Nothing stands out too much about this aroma, but given the style guidelines, I think the aroma is extremely representative.\t\tT - When I saw what this beer was classified here as a Wee Heavy at 7.0% abv, I was skeptical. Upon tasting the beer, though, this is an extremely accurate classification, given the 2 main scottish ale categories. Somehow, the alcohol character of this ale beats its way through the sweet malt to make its presence known. My initial taste was slightly metallic, but this flavor faded with subsequent sips. It seems the metallic taste lives mostly in the head, as when I topped up my glass, it returned with assertiveness. Were it not for this off-flavor, I'd rate this beer much higher.\t\tM - Slightly slick, but to a degree that is actually pleasant. Slightly excessive carbonation for my tastes, lending a prickly character that is not in keeping with my tastes for this beer. A more subdued carbonation level would allow the sweet maltiness to take hold a bit more. Still, pleasant overall in the mouth.\t\tD - One does not often endeavor to sit down and drink more than a few Wee Heavys. That being said, I would gladly accept a few of these on a cool night. Drinkable, but enough's enough.\t\tOverall - I quite liked this beer, Wee Heavy being among my favorite styles. I'd have liked to see a bit more complexity, perhaps some smokiness?

Mild, yet noticable hopping into the finish. Very, very much in the UK style, in terms of integration and subtlety. I definitely detect some fuggles woody earthiness, with a trace of floral flavor. The alcohol is completely hidden. A slight tartness arrives right in the end, something very much like San Francisco style sourdough bread. It actually balances the malt out very well, making the brew something more like a stronger scottish ale, 80 aught or so. A fairly light body for the style, something on the edge of medium to full, with ever so soft, cask-like carbonation. An extremely smooth mouthfeel, unlike anything you get in the states. Silken.\tA very pleasing, integrated flavor. Nothing really jumps out, the flavors weaving between each other to reappear later. The balance is fantastic, with a more gentle malt flavor and a more pronounced hopping than I'm accustomed to in the style.

Seriously, this is smoky as hell, but if you think Scotch, that becomes a very nice thing.\t\tThe base of this beer is an inconspicuous stout of sorts with some mild roasted barley with hints of dark fruit and chocolate but is immediately followed up and utterly dominated by that terrific Lagavulin peat. \t\tThe mouth feel is very light and smooth and it leaves my mouth exceptionally dry. This seems to work well with the smoky nature of this beer.\t\tHonestly, on my first sip, I was a bit put off, but after I started to think of this beer as a sort of Scotch, I really started to like it. Im also really enjoying the finish. With a Scotch, the smoke fades into the alcohol too much, but with the beer, its just you and the peat for quite some time.

Nothing is over powering, perhaps the most balanced bourbon aged beer I've had. I want to rank this poorly for not being what I had hoped, but truth be told this just isn't an imperial stout at least at heart and darn if it isn't tasty.

This is a super hazy burnt orange color instead. Head isn\'t huge but there\'s a crown and skim that keeps kicking for a long while. Pretty healthy bubble action too. I\'m just a little puzzled because it looks more like a tripel.\t\tVery much Belgian in aroma, as far as the yeast character goes -- along with the kind of spicy smells you get in a (hate to say it again) tripel. But then there\'s bubblegum and banana, as in the finest of German\'s hefe weizens. Nevertheless, I like this smell very much and am already dismissing what the brewer says this is, style-wise. It simply has the makings of good beer. So far.\t\tTaste delivers a pretty authentic array of Belgian-ness. Fruity more than spicy (pear and peach, mostly), and there\'s a slight herbal twist to this. Yeast is also on the fruitier side, while the hops (Brewer\'s Gold) are clean and subtly threaded into the more prominent pale malt/Belgian yeast foreground. Ultimately this is fruity and a little sweet, but definitely not too sweet. Banana comes in, especially with some warming. Bubblegum lingers strongest in the finish.\t\tCarbonation is very much present and up front, but not cloying or annoying. A very "wet" (as opposed to dry) feel, slick and round, very pleasant in this aspect, as with all others.\t\tBalanced, very enjoyable, and worth $5 for this stubby-style flip-top bottle. But Dubbelicious might as well be called Tripelicious -- there seems to be some gray area here between dubbel and tripel. It\'s like a lower-ABV tripel, if such a thing could exist.

To begin any flavor that may be contained in this beer is incredibly watered down. I don't get any roasted, toasted, chocolate, etc malts at all. There is a tiny warmth on the end of the palate from the chilis. And if I tried reallly hard to be imaginitive while drinking this I could say it had some oak woodiness.

I really think the aroma instantly killed any chance I had at enjoying the flavor of this beer. Though the growler did open with a fresh hiss, maybe it wasn't sealed enough and that's what lead to the lack of carbonation and watery feel? I really don't know and I'm not sure I care. I gave this beer a chance but ended up drainpouring it after about 3 sips and letting it warm in my hand for 20 minutes. I think I just had such high expectations for what this could be...

Again it is not quite as citric in the flavor as other similar DIPAs which is what I love in DIPA's but it is still good when it comes to pure hops and the bitterness. Astringency of this brew is pretty prevalent. I can taste the malts trying to push through the strong bitterness but in the end the hops prevail.
